# Queryable provides a way to easily query and populate result objects, where
# the result sets may contain multiple data types. It provides functionality similar
# to ActiveRecords `find_by_sql` method. For example, lets say you have a query
# that you want to union together results from two different tables.
#
#   SELECT id, name, 'learning_path' AS content_type FROM learning_paths
#   UNION ALL
#   SELECT if, name, 'learning_objective' AS content_type FROM learning_objectives
#
# For this query, you would not want to use the ActiveRecord find_by_sql method
# because the result set would contain more than just one model type. Queryable
# addressese this by letting you create a generic Ruby class and including the
# Querable concern. For example:
#
#   class Result
#     include Queryable
#     attr_accessor :id, :name, :learning_path
#   end
#
#   sql = <<-SQL
#     SELECT id, name, 'learning_path' AS content_type FROM learning_paths
#     UNION ALL
#     SELECT if, name, 'learning_objective' AS content_type FROM learning_objectives
#   SQL
#
#   Result.find_by_sql(sql)
#
# The concern also has a method of pagination that mimics WillPaginate's
# `paginate_by_sql` method. This is an example of paginating records
#
#   Result.paginate_by_sql(sql, page: page, per_page: per_page)

    #
    # @developers = Developer.paginate_by_sql ['select * from developers where salary > ?', 80000],
    #                          :page => params[:page], :per_page => 3
    #
    # A query for counting rows will automatically be generated if you don't
    # supply <tt>:total_entries</tt>. If you experience problems with this
    # generated SQL, you might want to perform the count manually in your
    # application.
